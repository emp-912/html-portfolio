<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an international student from China and have been studying in the US for
  a year now. I am gradually learning more programming knowledge to help me
  become a full-stack developer.
</p>

<p>
  After one semester in school, I realized that the programming knowledge in
  school is not enough for me to achieve what I want to do after graduation, in
  the second semester I followed Alexdev from Udemy to learn C# to make an RPG
  game through Unity. I plan to learn JavaScript, html, and JAVA in the future,
  and I hope to motivate myself by continuing to learn.
